    <h2>PCB Prototyping</h2>

    <p><span class="mercury">Mercury S&amp;SG</span> offer premium PCB prototyping services, but without the cost premiums often associated with fast-turnaround rapid PCB prototyping, enabling customers to get their products proven in the fastest time.</p>

    <h4>Design for cost service</h4>

    <p>We offer suggestions for alternative parts on the build, whilst meeting the performance requirements, may have significant cost savings over the specified parts and greater availability. Working with <span class="mercury">Mercury</span> at this crucial stage adds great value to the project, especially in the long term.</p>
    
    <p class="confirm">By optimising the <em>BOM</em> and PCB layout, the cost of material and assembly along with availability can be accurately forecasted offering stability beyond the initial trial batches.</p>

    <p class="confirm">We work with <em>free issue</em> components, as well as full or partial procurement.</p>
    

    <h2>PCB Assembly Service</h2>

    <p class="confirm">Surface Mount (SMT) PCB assembly is achieved with fully automated lines with a throughput of 30,000 components per hour, combined with a flexibility to handle a wide range of components, conventional through <em>hole</em> and hybrid PCBs, enable us to offer a high performance flexible PFB assembly service.</p>

    <p class="confirm">The level of automation means we are well placed to assemble larger volumnes of PCBs in hours, as well as having <em>cells</em> focused on small batches that are regularly monitored in <em>allerdanes</em> with IPC-A-610 standards and our stringent quality processes.</p>
